<h3>Program Grading Guidelines</h3>
</center>
Whereas correct operation of a program is the critical element of
success,
there are other less apparent (but no less important) features that a
program
should include to be considered proper. The following should assist you
when writing programs to determine what to emphasize in your code.
These
guidelines essentially list all points which I feel are crucial to good
programming skills and that all of your forthcoming programs will
include
most, if not all, of these items.<br>
<br>
You should consider code that is submitted for assignments as
production code.<br>
<p>Your programs should include the following:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Good comments including the author and date at the top of the
source file. Inline comments
should
include
a heading describing what the program does and a heading for
every&nbsp;
method describing what the method does.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Spaces, tabs, and blank lines. This GREATLY aids readability.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Meaningful variable names and parameter passing.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Properly declaring classes, methods and variables.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Breaking up large programming tasks into separate, logical
classes and
methods.</li>
</ol>
The following example demonstrates good coding conventions, commets,
and readability (Click on the image to see a larger-sized image appear
in a separate window.)<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><a target="blank"
 href="./ExampleProgram.png"><img alt="" src="./ExampleProgram.png"
 style="border: 0px solid ; width: 400px; height: 414px;"></a><br>
</div>
<br>
What NOT to include? Be sure to remove all old, commented-out lines of
code. Consider the following code: ((Click on the image to see a
larger-sized image appear
in a separate window.)<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><a target="blank"
 href="./ExampleProgram2.png"><img alt="" src="./ExampleProgram2.png"
 style="border: 0px solid ; width: 250px; height: 124px;"></a><br>
</div>
The old, commented-out lines of code do not add any functionality to
the code and should be removed from all submitted code assignments.<br>
<br>
Most programming assignments will include a grading rubric which
describes in detail the specific requirements for each assignment.
However, in general, your forthcoming programs will be graded according
to the following
criteria:
<ol>
  <li>Does the program work correctly?</li>
  <li>Was the program turned in on time?</li>
  <li>Did the author follow directions from the assignment?</li>
  <li>Did the author follow the points listed above?<br>
    <br>
  </li>
</ol>
Many companies and organizations frequently have guidelines for coding
conventions. In particular, Google has posted a <a target="_blank"

for several languages including <a target="_blank"

and <a target="_blank"
